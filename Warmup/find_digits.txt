You are given an integer N. Find the digits in this number that exactly divide
N(division that leaves 0 as remainder) and display their count. For N=24, there
are 2 digits − 2 & 4. Both of these digits exactly divide 24. So our answer is 2

Note

If the same number is repeated twice at different positions, it should be
counted twice, e.g., For N=122, 2 divides 122 exactly and occurs at ones' and
tens' position. So for this case, our answer is 3.
Division by 0 is undefined.
Input Format

The first line contains T (number of test cases) followed by T lines (each
containing an integer N).

Constraints
1≤T≤15
0<N<1010

Output Format

For each test case, display the count of digits in N that exactly divide N in a
separate line.

Sample Input

2
12
1012
Sample Output

2
3
Explanation

2 digits in the number 12 divide the number exactly. Digits at tens' place, 1,
divides 12 exactly in 12 parts, and digit at ones' place, 2 divides 12 equally
in 6 parts.

1 divides 1012 at two places and 2 divides it at one place. Divide by 0 is an
undefined behaviour and it will not be counted.
