This is a simple challenge to get things started. Given a sorted array (ar) and
a number (V), can you print the index location of V in the array?

{The next section describes the input format. You can often skip it, if you are
using included methods. }

Input Format
There will be three lines of input:

V - the value that has to be searched.
n - the size of the array.
ar - n numbers that make up the array.
Output Format
Output the index of V in the array.

{The next section describes the constraints and ranges of the input. You should
check this section to know the range of the input. }

Constraints
1<=n<=1000
-1000 <=x <= 1000 , x âˆˆ ar

{This "sample" shows the first input test case. It is often useful to go through
the sample to understand a challenge. }

Sample Input

4
6
1 4 5 7 9 12
Sample Output

1
Explanation
V = 4. The value 4 is located at the 1st index in the array, so the answer is 1.
