Jamal works for a food delivery company that labels each food with a positive
integer from 1 to m. At the beginning of each day, he receives q food delivery
requests. Each request is in the form foodi personk, meaning he must buy foodi
from one of the restaurants that make it and deliver it to personk. He must
deliver each request in the same order in which he received it.

Jamal's city is organized like a complete binary tree where personk lives at
intersection k. As a reminder, a complete binary tree is a binary tree in which
every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled and all the nodes
are as far left as possible:

The city has a restaurant at each intersection, and traveling from an
intersection to an adjacent intersection takes 1 minute. Jamal starts his
workday at intersection and can't hold more than one food item at a time.

Given the layout of the city and Jamal's sequence of delivery requests,
calculate the minimum time it will take him to deliver all the requests in the
order he received them.

Input Format
* The first line contains three space-separated positive integers describing the
  respective values of n (the number of intersections), m (the number of types
  of foods), and q (the number of delivery requests).
* Each line i of the m subsequent lines (where 1 <= i <= m) contains a maximum
  of 11 space-separated positive integers. The first integer denotes the number
  of restaurants that make food type i. The remaining numbers on the line denote
  the restaurants that make the food type i.
* Each line j of the q subsequent lines contains a food order request in the
  form foodi personk, where foodi is the type of food being ordered and personk
  is the person it must be delivered to.

Constraints
* 1 <= n <= 10^5
* 1 <= m <= 10^4
* 1 <= q <= 10^5
* Each food is made by a maximum of restaurants.

Output Format
Print the amount of time (in minutes) it takes for Jamal to deliver all q
food requests.

Explanation
We have m=5 foods:
1. Food type 1 is available from the restaurants at intersections 1, 4, and 5.
2. Food type 2 is available from the restaurant at intersection 3.
3. Food type 3 is available from the restaurants at intersections 2, 3, and 5.
4. Food type 4 is available from the restaurants at intersections 1, 3, 4, and 5
5. Food type 5 is available from the restaurants at intersections 1, 2, and 5.

Jamal has the following q=6 delivery requests:
1. Buy food type 5 and deliver it to intersection 3.
2. Buy food type 3 and deliver it to intersection 5.
3. Buy food type 3 and deliver it to intersection 2.
4. Buy food type 2 and deliver it to intersection 5.
5. Buy food type 2 and deliver it to intersection 1.
6. Buy food type 3 and deliver it to intersection 3.

Jamal's path is 1->3->2->5->2->3->5->3->1->3, where bolded intersections are
intersections in which Jamal completed a delivery. The length of this path is
1+2+1+1+2+3+3+1+1=15
