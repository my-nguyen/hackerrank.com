Victor loves building structures using popsicle sticks. Each time he goes to
Walmart, he purchases n identical popsicle sticks. When he gets home, he places
the sticks on a sheet of paper in such a way that they form mountains like the
ones in the following diagram:

               /\         /\/\
   /\         /  \       /    \
2 sticks    4 sticks    6 sticks

Victor builds mountains according to the following rules:
* The two bottom endpoints (i.e., the base) of the mountain always touch the
  ground.
* None of the intermediate sticks between the mountain's left and right
  endpoints can be below ground level.
* Sticks are only placed at or angles with the ground.
* No stick is ever placed inside the walls of a mountain.

The diagram below demonstrates structures that violate these rules and are not allowed:

 /\/\/\     /\  /\/\     /_\         /\
/             \/        /   \       /\ \
 Rule 1      Rule 2     Rule 3      Rule 4

Victor is curious to know how many different types of mountains he can build
following the rules above; two mountains are considered to be different if they
look different. Given the value of n for t trips to Walmart, print the number of
mountains he can build using up to sticks on a new line. As this value can be
quite large, print each answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

Input Format
* The first line contains an integer, t, denoting the number of trips to Walmart.
* Each of the t subsequent lines contains an integer, n, denoting the number of
  sticks Victor purchased during that trip to Walmart.

Constraints
* It is guaranteed that is always an even number.

Output Format
For each trip to Walmart, print the number of structures Victor can build using
up to n sticks, modulo 10^9 + 7, on a new line.

Explanation

Victor makes trips to Walmart to puchase popsicle sticks:

1. During the first trip, Victor can build one mountain with his sticks:
/\
Thus, we print 1 on a new line.

2. During the second trip, Victor can build eight mountains with his sticks:
                     /\          /\/\
/\      /\/\        /  \        /    \

                       /\
 /\          /\       /  \
/  \/\    /\/  \     /    \      /\/\/\

Thus, we print 8 on a new line.
