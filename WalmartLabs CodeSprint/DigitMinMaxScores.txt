A digit is a min-digit in a number if it is less than both its adjacent digits.
Similarly, a digit is a max-digit in a number if it is greater than both its
adjacent digits. The min-max-score of number is the total number of min-digits
and max-digits (ignoring the first and last digit) contained in it. Given a and
b, find the sum of the min-max-scores of all numbers between a and b (including
a and b).

Input Format
Two lines consisting of two integers a and b.

Constraints
1 <= a <= b <= 10^12

Output Format
Sum(min-max-score of all numbers between a and b)

Sample Input
100
105

Sample Output
5

Explanation
For each digit in the number there must exist a left and right adjacent digit.

The middle digit 0 in 100 is neither a min digit nor max digit because its right
adjacent digit is not greater than 0. The numbers 101 through 105 the 0 in the
middle i.e; the ten's place is less than both it's left and right adjacent
digit. This gives us 5 min-digits. So the answer is 5.
